# Cognitive Modules Section

## 2. Cognitive Modules
The cognitive modules define how the generative agents (NPCs) perceive, plan, execute, reflect, and converse within the environment. Here's a breakdown of how each module works:

### 2.1 Plan Module (`plan.py`)
The Plan module manages the long-term scheduling and task decomposition for agents. It generates daily routines, hourly schedules, and specific action plans. NPCs have personal daily routines that span from waking up to completing tasks like eating, working, or socializing. Key functions include:

- `generate_wake_up_hour`: Determines when the NPC wakes up.
- `generate_first_daily_plan`: Creates a broad daily plan of actions.
- `generate_hourly_schedule`: Converts the daily plan into hour-by-hour actions (e.g., "eating breakfast," "working on a project").
- `generate_task_decomp`: Decomposes high-level tasks into smaller steps (e.g., "eat breakfast" into "prepare food, sit down, eat").
- `_determine_action`: Based on the hourly schedule, this function determines the next action for the NPC and updates the task decomposition if needed.

This module is crucial for generating a realistic simulation of daily NPC life, ensuring that each character follows a personalized schedule based on their personality and past experiences.

### 2.2 Perceive Module (`perceive.py`)
The Perceive module allows NPCs to observe their environment and other NPCs within a certain vision radius. They take note of events around them (e.g., conversations, actions) and store them in their memory. Important aspects include:

- `generate_poig_score`: Assigns an emotional poignancy score to perceived events based on their significance.
- `perceive`: The core function that gathers information about nearby tiles in the maze (environment) and logs any new events or spaces the NPC hasn't seen before. If an event or interaction is new, it gets saved to the NPC's memory.

This module defines how NPCs become aware of their surroundings, which affects their decision-making and memory. NPCs "see" things happening nearby, whether events or other NPCs, which informs their future actions.

### 2.3 Execute Module (`execute.py`)
The Execute module handles the actual carrying out of actions planned by the NPC. It processes the plan generated by the NPC and determines how they navigate the environment to complete tasks:

- `execute`: Takes the generated plan (e.g., move to a specific location or interact with another NPC) and translates it into coordinates and movements in the maze. It ensures that NPCs follow a path toward their goal while avoiding collisions with obstacles or other NPCs.

The execute module is central to how NPCs physically move through the world, determining which actions they take and how they navigate the environment to complete those tasks.

### 2.4 Converse Module (`converse.py`)
The Converse module handles interactions and dialogues between NPCs. When two NPCs encounter each other, this module generates conversation topics and dialogue based on their memory and current context:

- `generate_agent_chat`: Generates a full conversation between two NPCs based on past interactions, their relationship, and current events in the environment.
- `agent_chat_v2`: A more advanced version that allows for iterative, dynamic conversations between NPCs, factoring in emotional responses and the memory of previous chats.

This module adds depth to NPC-to-NPC interaction, enabling the generation of realistic and meaningful conversations that impact relationships and social dynamics within the simulation.

### 2.5 Reflect Module (`reflect.py`)
The Reflect module enables NPCs to think about past events and conversations. It helps them analyze and process interactions, leading to changes in their behavior or future plans:

- `run_reflect`: Runs the reflection process, generating insights from past events and storing these as thoughts in the NPC's memory.
- `generate_focal_points`: Identifies key events or interactions that the NPC should focus on during reflection.

Reflection is key for NPCs to adapt to their environment and evolve their behavior based on previous experiences. This module allows NPCs to form long-term memories and learn from their actions.

### 2.6 Retrieve Module (`retrieve.py`)
The Retrieve module helps NPCs recall relevant past events and thoughts from memory. This influences their current decisions, interactions, and conversations:

- `retrieve`: Retrieves thoughts and events from memory based on current circumstances, ensuring NPCs act with context and memory of their past.
- `cos_sim`: Measures the similarity between events in memory and current events, helping the NPC decide which memories are most relevant.

This module is critical for providing continuity in NPC behavior, ensuring that characters remember important past events, conversations, or relationships and act accordingly.
